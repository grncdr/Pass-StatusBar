# Pass StatusBar

This is a tiny MacRuby status bar application for managing/copying GPG
encrypted passwords. It should interoperate cleanly with the [pass][pass]
password manager.

## Prerequisites

A working GPG2 install. I recommend using [GPGTools][GPGTools] as it provides a
nice graphical interface for unlocking your private key.

[GPGTools]: https://www.gpgtools.org/installer/index.html

## Installation

After you've installed GPGTools, you should be able to build this application
using Xcode. Binary distributions are coming soon.
